# NAME:
#    azimedian
#
# PURPOSE:
#    Compute the azimuthal median of a two-dimensional data set
#    over angles about its center.
#
# CATEGORY:
#    Image Processing
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE:
#    result = azimedian(data)
#
# INPUTS:
#    data: two dimensional array of any type except string or complex
#
# KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
#    center: coordinates of center: [xc, yc].  Default is to use data's
#        geometric center.
#
#    rad: maximum radius of average [pixels]
#        Default: half the minimum dimension of the image.
#
#    weight: relative weighting of each pixel in data.
#        Default: uniform weighting.
#
#    deinterlace: If set to an even number, average only over even 
#        numbered lines.  Similarly if set to an odd number.
#        This is useful for analyzing interlaced video images.
#
# OUTPUTS:
#    result: data averaged over angles as a function of radius from
#        the center point, measured in pixels.  Result is single
#        precision.
#
# KEYWORD OUTPUTS:
#    rho: the radial position of each pixel in DATA relative to the
#        center at (xc, yc).
#
#    values: Azimuthal median at each pixel.
#
#    deviates: difference between DATA and azimuthal median at each
#        pixel.
#
# PROCEDURE:
#    data[y, x] sits at radius rrho = sqrt((x-xc)**2 + (y-yc)**2) 
#        from the center, (xc, yc).  Let R be the integer part
#        of rho, and dR the fractional part.  Then this point is
#        averaged into result(R) with a weight 1-dR and into
#        result(R+1) with a weight dR.
#
# RESTRICTIONS:
#    data must be two-dimensional and must not be string type

    Compute the azimuthal median of a two-dimensional data set
    over angles about its center.

    Inputs:
    data: two dimensional array of any type except string or complex

    Parameters:
    center: coordinates of center: [xc, yc].  Default is to use data's
        geometric center.

    rad: maximum radius of average [pixels]
        Default: half the minimum dimension of the image.
        Must be an int.

    weight: relative weighting of each pixel in data.
        Default: uniform weighting.

    deinterlace: If set to an even number, average only over even 
        numbered lines.  Similarly if set to an odd number.
